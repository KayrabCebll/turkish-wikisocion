<p>Logical Intuitive Introvert (LII) INTj: Ti-Ne
</p><p>Characteristics: <br />
♦ Excels in analytical thinking; presents his ideas with clarity and some measure of order; notices flaws, alternative options, and brings them up in a discussion.<br />
♦ Mentally comprehends and models the entire system; captures a notion and then systematizes it, suggesting simplified explanations and schematics.<br />
♦ Can distinguish what's important from what is secondary; however, often neglects details and specifics in presenting material, preferring to present a more general (vague) overview of the topic or the situation.<br />
♦ Careful, does not rush into action; prefers preparation, discussion and mental exploration of options beforehand; takes note of alternative options; dislikes topics that have little potential for mental exploration.<br />
♦ Politely formal and reserved in communication; prefers simple and democratic relations.
</p><p>LII generalizes and systematizes prospective ideas. He is interested in uncovering underlying regularities and patterns. On foundation of these, he comes up with new ideas, theories and maxims, and corrects the existing ones. His view is abstracted away from the details. Instead he looks into the general processes and uncovers phenomena that lie at their core. He skillfully designs abstracted, generalized schematics and utilizes them. In work and production, he points out potential problems in systems, evaluates and debugs existing programs. He executes his duties with diligence and care.
</p><p>LII is restrained. He is in good control of himself and his own behavior and does not allow for much deviation. He is an ascetic, with overstated demands for himself and for others, and may restrict himself in all conveniences. He is austere in his thoughts, and does not welcome diversions from the selected course of thought or action. 
</p><p>LII lives in the world of ideas, technologies, methods, algorithms. He carefully and critically considers potentialities, ideas, theories, with "sixth sense" detects possible deviations from projected course of development of events. Considers that the product or result must have certain indispensable characteristics, such as longevity, convenience, but nothing that would be superfluous. He often does not notice or take into consideration anything which may be pleasing from a personal stand point.
</p><p>He acutely feels contradictions, deficiencies, and latent defects in surrounding world. He can see deficiencies in objects, in people, in society, and reveal them under certain conditions with a slightly ironic tone, in such way so that others also take note of them. He criticizes excessive self-confidence, rashness, does not support brash actions, which are unreasonable from his point of view. He constantly thinks of timeliness or inopportunity of implementation of his intents. Sayings such as "initiative will be penalized" are like a balm for his soul, as he does not consider it is necessary to run ahead. In his opinion, it is best to live with aforethought and reason, and everything else will simply fall into place.
</p><p>Conceptual work of LIIs consists of bringing together and uniting interdependent views on specific phenomena. He is constantly analyzing, weighting, looking for alternative points of view, trying to understand something relevant. He usually has a lot of questions on any subject that he cannot understand and resolve on his own.
</p><p>LII is an analyst who sees any system, any problem as a whole. If he has to deal with many details, he puts them together and links them to the whole. He perceives work as series of sensibly and economically weighed steps. Before starting, it is necessary for LII to explore all possibilities and resolve all issues concerning his project or duties, therefore, he tends to ask many questions out of concern. LII usually carries through all his undertakings to their end, overcoming difficulties independently. He is thorough and reliable, and may try to do everything by his own efforts. He prefers to ponder along on complex problems. Challenges, especially mental ones, do not prevent him from carrying out his job.
</p><p>LII considers his own opinions as the most valid ones and accepts a differing opinion only if it can be made to coincide with his own judgement. He expects others to adjust themselves to meet his conclusions, demands, and judgments. When challenged, he skillfully argues for his rightness, providing meticulous analytic reasoning,that corresponds to how he internally understands the problem. If told that his judgement is not correct, LII may feel irritated. He often feels that he has intellectual advantage, may see himself in position of being "smarter" than others, therefore, it is difficult for him to accept the superiority and authority of another. If put into a position of a leader himself, he can be intolerant of having subordinates who demonstrate more intelligence than him, and thus may seek out those who are less competent—to appear "cleverer" among them. 
</p><p>LII often speaks in brief statements and formulations and provides schematics of his thoughts. May appear to be austere, unemotional person, who rarely displays warm affect*. Healthy LIIs value harmony, reciprocity, and possess a developed sense of self-esteem while not being vain. If LII seeks revenge, he will find and strike at the weakest spot of his opponent. He does not allow himself to be caught unprepared. 
(* translator's note: This is more true of Ti-INTjs than Ne-INTjs. The later can have episodes of acute emotional sensitivity.)
</p><p>LII may feel discouraged when he has to face problems and challenges that necessitate him to deal with the physical world, such as requiring care and provision. When he falls sick, he may not show his ailments not to burden those around him. In such times he needs kind, soft, sensitive attitude for he doesn't know well how to concern and care for himself.

Still, he hopes for a positive outcome. 
</p><p>IEI knows how to adapt to changing conditions and unexpected interruptions in plans. He is restrained, good-natured, and attentive to others.
