<h2><span id="ILE_.28Don_Quixote.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="ILE_(Don_Quixote)">ILE (Don Quixote)</span></h2>
<p>People of this type are discerning of latent possibilities of people, things, objects, ideas, developments and discoveries. They are interested in everything new and unexpected, and generate a lot of ideas. However, it is easier for them to talk of ideas or hypotheses than to implement them into practical development and implementation. They realize this themselves, thus do not hesitate to ask others for help. As a rule, they have a very large circle of acquaintances. 
</p><p>The range of their curiosity is very broad. They tend to read a lot and on different topics. Due to their intuitive submergence, they are quite scattered - may forget things, not to notice a friend, or pass by their stop on public transport. His thoughts and ideas ILE tries to articulate logically, sometimes developing rather sophisticated and interesting theories, which he may use for minor everyday activities as well as for serious research. In this way, for example, Galileo Galilei discovered by logical methods the law of falling bodies, and what we call the principle of Galilean relativity; Karl Marx created the theory of economic relations; Albert Einstein - Theory of Relativity, and Sigmund Freud - his famous theory of psychoanalysis.
</p><p>Typically, ILE looks calm and relaxed, but in extreme situations becomes mobilized, showing considerable willpower and determination. If he is being threatened, he can deliver a sharp rebuff, which is often surprising to people around him. If he's playing on a team, by shouts and orders he can mobilize his teammates. Dislikes clarifying and sorting out relationships and conversations on this topic - this irritates him. At times, in the name of reason, tends to ignore the moral demands of society - as Sigmund Freud published his research on sexuality despite the opinion of the public, which has turned away from him.
</p>
<h2><span id="SEI_.28Dumas.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="SEI_(Dumas)">SEI (Dumas)</span></h2>
<p>People of this type are very perceptive of the world through their subtle sensations. Artistic productions, pictures, architecture, music, paintings, literature - bring up an aesthetic reaction in them. Smells, sounds, images and colors are remembered for a lifetime. A person of this type knows how to "situate" himself in space, how to feel at ease in the most unfavorable conditions, even if this person is a climber who is climbing a mountain or a traveler on a long trip, he seeks to "adapt to the terrain", and no one better than him is able to find the "sweet spots". He senses his own condition, as well as the state of people around him. He feels the emotions of other people around him, manipulates these emotions, may say consoling and supporting words, to remove irritability.
</p>
<h2><span id="ESE_.28Hugo.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="ESE_(Hugo)">ESE (Hugo)</span></h2>
<p>People belonging to this type are usually very emotionally perceive reality - live emotions that often seem to others too intense. "Hugo" sees very emotional state of other people, their mood and feelings. It appreciates the family - it comes first for him. He likes to go to visit and welcomes visitors. "The greatest luxury - Antoine de SentOkzyuperi wrote - it is the luxury of human communication." In chatting with friends "Hugo" has spared no time. His emotional wildness ( "furious Hugo") can show Xia and incendiary speech to the audience, and in the fiery verses, and in the all-consuming love.
</p><p>It is "a strong, cheerful, open-minded person." Rational and persistent: putting a goal, it seeks to achieve, in spite of any obstacles. Thus, H. Schliemann in childhood set about trying to find the city of Troy, sung by Homer. He grew up, became a merchant, learned many languages, and then organized the expedition-tion. And he found Troy because passionately believed in it. I must say that the humanities disciplines, such as linguistics, in "Hugo" exceptional ability. Engels knew about a dozen European languages. "Hugo", being engaged in the study of something, is a card file with the words, terms, plans his actions. Among the "Hugo" a lot of revolutionary politics: Camille Desmoulins, George Washington, Sima Bolivar, Che Guevara. "Hugo" loves to create comfort and coziness, lead his home in the aesthetic appearance, likes to work with his hands, perfectly prepared and delicious.
