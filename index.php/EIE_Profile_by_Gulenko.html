<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_description">General description</span></h2>
<p>The EIE (ENFj) has a deep capacity for emotions and acutely feels the state of other people. Artistic, sublime, and romantic in his feelings. Easily manages his external expressions, alternating between being dramatic or assertive. He aims for polite communication, without any crudeness, coarseness, and prodding. 
</p><p>The EIE warns people about impending dangers. He has a good sense for potentially negative courses of events - prepares for them in advance, thinks of alternative exists and options. Interested in topics related to mysterious phenomena. Loves to spend time in solitude and to ponder about the meaning of life, about the past and the future. Considers problems from a global, generalized perspective.
</p><p>At work his goal is to mobilize other people to do work, while the specifics and details of it he leaves up to others to figure out. Has a tendency to accumulate and organize information on a topic or area that captures his interest, but rarely comes back to something he has already learned. Will tackle major problems, but has difficulties with running into failure. Getting absorbed by a project or some undertaking may forget about nourishment and rest. 
</p><p>The EIE feels tormented by doubts and uncertainties concerning the need to provide for himself. He poorly monitors his own physical state and has difficulty getting rid of bad habits. Distrustful of compliments. Dresses either in an accentuated aristocratic manner or very plainly. In nutrition tends to mix products of opposing tastes.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Detailed_description">Detailed description</span></h2>
<p>The EIE encompasses and manages a very wide range of emotional states. Dramatic emotions quickly turn into comic ones or interweave together, however, in company of strangers and unfamiliar people he can behave calmly and hold himself with dignity. Endowed with the gift of emotional empathy, can experience emotions of another person as if they were his own. Expressive in gestures, gaze, intonation, and other emotional expressions. A good actor or speaker. Continually reinvents and reincarnates himself in some style. Often aggravates the situation and welcomes the emotional tension that comes with this. People in his proximity may find it difficult to dealing with his type of emotional pressuring. The EIE cannot find peace and serenity himself; he or she overflows with negative emotions, which can lead to emotional and mental breakdowns.
</p><p>The EIE is very perceptive of development of situations over time. Sensing a potentially negative situation upcoming, he prepares for it in advance and thinks about alternative solutions and ways out. Warns others about the risks they may face. Often wavers and experiences doubt and hesitation, which makes it difficult for him to make important decisions. However, once the decision has been made, he will not hesitate any longer and will not look back. Internally, the EIE is very contradictory. He is attuned to inconsistencies between what people say and what they do, conflicts and hypocrisy. Often interested in topics related to destiny, fate, and other mysterious phenomena. Over time, his worldviews may change to something diametrically opposite of what he has previously believed.
</p><p>Likes being involved in projects that bring about concrete benefits. He does quality work and does not like to go back and redo anything. Enjoys challenging himself and mastering difficult disciplines. By temperament impatient and restless. Sitting in one place for a long time can even lead to muscle spasms. Finds it difficult to relax even when he is sleeping. Usually has superior organizational skills, however, becomes depleted by prolonged business activity. Gives others a lot of small tasks, but has no time to keep track of everything and becomes stressed by this. Has a hard time working while being watched. Any quick movements and sudden noises irritate him, however, constant mild background sounds often improve his efficiency.
</p><p>EIE often feels uneasy about any physical ailments and suffering. Has difficulty getting rid of bad habits. In sexual matters, often falls to extremes: from indifference to perversion. Pays much attention to his own appearance, especially surface aesthetics that can bring him much joy or disappointment.

May choose the life of a recluse.
</p><p>EIE is in need of a certain level of organization and order around himself, the absence of which can even affect his physical well-being. Living within some framework of a strict system does much good for him. Uncertainty, unpredictability, and constant changes of schedule have poor effect on his health. He is very keen on catching the slightest deviation from the usual scheme of events. Relaxes over meticulous studies that require concentration.

</p><p>At times he vigorously protests against use of coarse force and brutality. Often strives for courteous and helpful conduct towards people, but in a fit of passion won't stop at anything. His own strength increases dramatically in an extreme situation (e.g. panic, confusion). In such cases, he behaves confidently. However, he becomes helpless to counter an inappropriate use force if he has been emotionally and spiritually broken. In such situations he resigns to fate as to an inevitability. Only use of direct force can snap him out of hysterical state of being. A sudden strike sobers him up from his emotional excesses. He is in need of external help to contain his uncontrollable emotions and reduce the grip that they have on him.
</p><p>EIE is often not sure of the durability of his relationships with other people. Thus he seeks a constant verbal or other kind of reassurance. He treats his contestants with much jealousy and is capable of predicting the development of their relationships over time. Criticizes the manners and philosophical view points of others. Himself is either a loyal and devoted partner or a Don Juan. His sore spot is the reliability of relations with people whom he trusts. Those who have once misled him he does not forgive. He is quick to take offense and can be vindictive. Prefers to keep at a distance from people. Often will greatly lower his own worth in the eyes of others, but is given into extremes and can as well narcissistically inflate and obsess over other people.
</p><p>At work can show the most unexpected talents and abilities. Desires very much for his achievements to be praised. Gravitates towards unconventional, sometimes shocking behaviors. Knows how to use the power of the people as well as delegate the roles within a group. He often makes for a good teacher and a mentor to others. His personality is shaped by hard work. Wishes for well-being and benefit of all mankind and is not satisfied with only local and partial solutions to the problems. Will often take an uncompromising centrist stance on issues that he perceives as only secondary. Looks for the most complex and exciting enterprises. Worries a lot if he is criticized because he perceives this as a defeat of his ideals. Has an innate feeling of own inferiority for which he compensates by demonstrative behaviors.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Features_of_behavior">Features of behavior</span></h2>
<p>One of the most characteristic features of EIE's behavior that allows to confidently identify this sociotype - is the attitude towards people depending on their position in the hierarchy of power. If a person is lower in position than him, the EIE's attitude is coolly dismissive, while towards higher standing people he is respectful. The EIE believes in authority and respects the principle of "leaderism". Emphasizes the uniqueness of the idea with which he is obsessed in the moment. Another feature of behavior common to many EIEs is that they cannot work side-by-side with someone in front of others. They would rather give others all sorts of assignments and orders to send them to another place. EIE manners, especially in an <a href="EIE_subtypes.html" title="EIE subtypes">intuitive subtype</a>, can be very idiosyncratic and distinctive in terms of their accordance with the current norms. Sometimes he/she behaves as a person from the last century. In their manners there is something noble, aristocratic. The EIE is oriented at exclusively polite, appropriate, and correct interaction, without elements of coarseness, crudeness, and prodding. He easily takes up the resolution of the most difficult, as it would seem, problems. For example, learning several foreign languages ​​in a short period of time. By his behavior the EIE as if demonstrates the conditional nature of the barriers that limit the possibilities of a human being. In this way Georgi Lozanov has devised a method of intensive study of foreign languages ​​in a short period of time. Sometimes shows inclination to mysticism, to unusual, mysterious phenomena, omens, and exotic religions, etc. Likes to isolate him/herself and in solitude reflect on the meaning of life, and the place and role of person within it.

The EIE's figure is often slim, with thin arms and legs. His gait is brisk and fast - its quickness is more expressed with the emotional component. EIEs are very agile and mobile people. At the same time, they have poor coordination in their movements. An impression might arise that they are purposefully showing off. Characteristic of how an EIE holds him/herself in public - is with some majesty, even arrogance. This impression is created at a distance, due to the fact that the EIE hold his head high, looking bit above and beyond the person in conversation. EIE's clothes is often disharmonious. Frequently, their accessories are not matched well. Their jewelry, for example, may not match the general style of their clothing. As a rule, there is one detail that catches the eye that does not harmoniously tie in with their overall look. Though by itself this detail seems to be perfectly normal. Being perceptive of this, people of EIE sociotype are usually picky about their appearance and dislike when it is being evaluated.

This job should also fulfill his requirements for personal growth and self-improvement. So often send Mentor to all sorts of seminars, workshops, and conferences. He likes to perfect himself and also does a good job delivering reports. Mentor loves order and discipline in everything, but it is difficult for him to see to this personally. Try to be punctual, correct and disciplined in communication with him. It will strongly help your relations. He also likes people who can protect his interests, confidently and vigorously defend opinions. Working with the Mentor can be pretty messy: sometimes for a while you will not be able to get any concrete results out of him as he will be dramatically depicting for you all the possible difficulties that will arise. He also will try to impose on you his own strategy and his own schedule of work. Do not yield to him in any case: divide the work into small sequential steps, set deadlines and be strict with him about following them through. Ask for reports on completion of each step. This will mobilize the Mentor and make his work more organized, because it will make him feel the responsibility.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement">Recommendations for self-improvement</span></h2>
<p>The most developed side of your personality is the ability to experience intense emotions. You are the person with a complicated spiritual world, full of contrasts and contradictions. For the sake of true, deep feelings you can sacrifice quite a lot.
</p><p>You have an inherent poetic nature that you can express in metaphorical form, often dramatic, sometimes tragic-comic. You may have talent of an orator, who knows how to use speech to ignite many people.
</p><p>You can be said to be a visionary, a man of great foresight. You have a good feeling for crises ripening within developing situations and can take measures beforehand to avoid them. You seek to warn others about the possible troubles that threaten them. This is the expression of the humanitarian focus of your personality. You are a rather principled person and do not forgive insults and humiliations. To achieve this, you, weighing all pros and cons, are able to take the most drastic measures. However, in some cases, your principles can be inflexible and your decisiveness can be excessive. Aim to exercise restraint in emergency situations, try to make decisions in a calm state.
</p><p>Your main problem - the inability to avoid situations which bring you misery and discomfort. You do not always fit easily into the society and avoid unpleasant contact with uninteresting people. You show lack of confidence and certainly in your tastes, inability to properly track your own well-being.
</p><p>The inability to find an inner balance with yourself is characteristic of you. Avoid over-dramatization of the events. Discharge the accumulated emotions in creative self-expression: singing, playing musical instruments, theater, etc.
</p><p>Do not seek to make an impression at all costs. From this your interests or health will suffer. Dress according to weather, follow some order in nutrition, favor healthy foods. Try to keep your dress style consistent with the situation.
</p><p>Do not be as sensitive to compliments and evaluation of your appearance. Do not immediately assume wrongdoings. Train to work openly and in public to stop painfully perceiving attention to your work. Try to trust people more and avoid thinking that they mean harm to you.
</p><p>Another problem areas - a desire to show yourself as an enterprising, active man, but not demonstrating these skills in action. Do not exaggerate the significance of your initiatives. Always ask yourself realistically how likely is it that you will take action and whether these actions will lead to positive results. Overcome your desires to ignore the daily affairs, including maintenance of your home. Articulate your problems more concretely. Do not be pushy and intrusive with respect to others.
</p><p>Your interaction with people can be difficult also because of the manifestations of excessive formality. Avoid arrogance, be more democratic and straightforward with people. Do not overdo it with irony and ridicule. Your penchant for sarcasm can hurt people and turn them away from you.
