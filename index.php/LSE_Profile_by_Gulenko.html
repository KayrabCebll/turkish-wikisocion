<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_description">General description</span></h2>
<p>The LSE (ESTj) is assertive, operative, and hard-working. Cannot sit still not being engaged in anything. Prefers actions to words. Has a developed sense of responsibility. Fights chaos and disorder wherever he might be. Dislikes it when he is being distracted from what he is doing. If taking a break, he does it as thoroughly as he does his work.
</p><p>Appreciates merit and good quality above everything else. Tries to provide for his loved ones by means of increasing their material prosperity. Very caring. Comes to rescue when someone is threatened by physical danger. In such a situation acts with courage and determination. 
</p><p>Intolerant of trickery and wiles. Expresses his opinion directly. In business and practical dealings, he is dry and official, but in an informal atmosphere shows kindness and a sense of humor. Doesn't have sufficient diplomacy in relations - may get agitated, lose his temper. A stubborn debater, becomes hot-tempered when proving his correctness. Doesn't know how to make compliments. Dislikes empty chatter, though finds it difficult to cut off a phone conversation.
</p><p>Getting stuck in details of work, he sometimes doesn't finish it in time, which is very upsetting for him. Unprepared for unexpected events. Slowly learns and accepts new trends, developments, and styles; often is conservative and supports traditions.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Detailed_description">Detailed description</span></h2>
<p>The LSE is an assertive, energetic, hard-working person. Spends many hours each day working, as much as his work requires. Supporter of good quality, reliability, and productivity of labor. Searches for bold, innovative and unconventional technical solutions. Inclined towards rationalizing activities. Skillfully uses instruments and exploits technologies. Has an extremely practical turn of mind. Makes all of his evaluations from the point of view of feasibility and utility. Prudent and thrifty manager. Foresees the best ways to manage and utilize objects at his disposal. Makes preparations and provisions for the future. Teaches people how to live wisely, how to not waste their capabilities in vain.
</p><p>A very caring person. Ensures that his loved ones have an income and comfortable living conditions. Helps people not by words, but by deeds. Spends his vacation time resting as thoroughly as he was working. Loves holiday dinners, abundant food, often knows how to cook well himself. With pleasure gives gifts and presents surprises. Goes through physical weakness and ailments with difficulty, neglects his own illnesses. Often looks after health of others more willingly than after his own well-being. For him it's important to find the original cause of poor health. Usually looks tidy and neat and handles his belongings with care. Won't immediately use a new costume or clothing set, but instead will preserve it for the right occasion. Prefers strict business or classical styles. Pays particular attention to the cleanliness of shoes.
</p><p>In communication, the LSE seeks to show kindness and sense of humor. Demonstrates his good predisposition and positive emotions, though sometimes does so too abruptly. Becomes very hot tempered during arguments and disputes. When he is overtaken by emotions, he no longer hears the opinions of others and stubbornly insists on his own view point. Never openly admits that he was wrong. However, if a person remains discreet and restrained, and does not submit to his pressuring, he becomes more attentive and cautious. Can curb and restrain his own emotions by willful effort as well. Very much dislikes it when someone else interferes in his affairs or forces him to redo his work.

Out of entire flow of information he distinguishes that which may be useful for the planned work or project, and discards the rest as having no bearing to the matter at hand.

</p><p>The LSE copes better with functions of a hierarchical leader. A manager of this type is usually conservative by nature, dislikes taking risks, and adheres to established ways of operation. Tries to reach new goals by tried-and-tested methods, using old contacts and ties. Negatively perceives any criticism directed at him concerning this matter.
</p><p>The LSE bases his interactions with other people and business partners on basis of code of honor and rules of fair play. An opponent of trickery, lies, duplicity. His own integrity is founded on logical principles. In interpersonal relationships he is characterized by keeping a certain emotional distance; does not seek to come in close contact with many other people.

Tries to be in the midst of events, to have a wide circle of contacts who bring to him diverse information. Gravitates towards cooperation. Tries to discuss and align his interests with those of his partner. Nevertheless, finds it difficult to reach an acceptable compromise.

During such discussions, he can get excited, hot-tempered, and stubbornly prove his rightness. Inclined to exaggerate negative consequences or miscalculations of any project or event. Values ​​his reputation. It is on basis of this that it's possible to strike a compromise with representative of this sociotype.

The LSE is ready to sacrifice his personal interests for the interests of the collective. He is persistent in defending the interests of his employees.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions">Working conditions</span></h2>
<p>The stimulus that moves the LSE to work is the possibility of achieving high administrative or managerial status in a group. In short, he strives to direct and manage all affairs in his own way, and likes for his opinions to be taken into consideration. Of course, it would be easiest to appoint him to such a position - then you won't have problems neither with his team or department, nor with the LSE himself. Because if he is only a regular member of the team, and his managerial abilities don't find an application and appreciation, he will still try to intrude into your management affairs, even if this work isn't fully within his field of competence: he will tell you what to do, how it's best to proceed, and voice his criticisms of wrong actions. 
</p><p>From aside, it may seem that such a practical type of personality as an LSE should not have any problems in life. However, despite his organization, efficiency and rationality, the "Administrator" rarely feels happy and satisfied. He finds it difficult to keep inner soulful balance and maintain an optimistic outlook on life. He cannot relax and rest because he is constantly preoccupied with current affairs and worries about tomorrow. He feels constantly dissatisfied by people close to him, because they almost never have such level of integrity and responsibility in affairs as LSE would have liked to see from them. It can be said that the LSE is prevented from being happy by a "complex of eternal achiever", who seeks to obtain only the highest evaluations in life. Thus, the only thing that can ease his burden of "working for entire socion" is simple, soulful participation, calmly listening to his worries and concerns, and showing sympathy. Since this sociotype - is a linear-assertive type, it is pointless to try to convince him otherwise once he's already in agitated, negative state. You have to calmly wait out this storm and allow him to speak his out his heart and his mind. When he starts to calm down, here you can talk to him in a sincere and heartfelt manner, persuade him that not everything is as bad, and this has happened before, but all has ended well, etc. After he fully calms down, you may criticize him a little, explain that he himself was wrong and acted harshly, that not all people are bad and not always. Remind him of specific situations when people of whom he spoke badly demonstrated their competence and behaved themselves impeccably. The "Administrator" needs not only emotional support, but also constant unobtrusive instruction or education, which would precaution him from manifesting harsh attitudes in relation to other people.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement">Recommendations for self-improvement</span></h2>
<p>Your forte - is your strict logic that is based on concrete facts, which allows you to accurately calculate the practical aspect of any undertaking. You are a sober realist, capable of correctly evaluating the usefulness and effectiveness of any venture.
</p><p>You are usually clever, quick-thinking, and informed in the sphere of your engagement. You are an active and energetic person, who does not like to idly waste time, who knows what you want, and will strive to achieve it through hard work, persistence, and determination. You are able to use your material resources in effective and economical manner.
</p><p>You are also able to create material prosperity and comfort for yourself and your family members. You strive for a healthy, balanced, harmonious life, and don't spare you efforts in order to attain it, as well as stimulate others around you to various useful activities. You possess good organizational skills and know how to create suitable conditions for people to do work, to make them become interested and involved, and only then demand results from them. You highly value quality in work and are intolerant of lack of discipline and laziness.
</p><p>You like beautiful, high quality items, as well as tasty, healthy food. You like it when people evaluate you based on your merits, and don't impinge on your independence in selecting solutions or methods of action.
</p><p>One of your weak points is an inability to plan for alternative events for lengthy periods of time. You often find yourself overloaded with tasks, chores, and work that appear seemingly from nowhere, and require time to prepare for important events. You have difficulty foreseeing approaching danger or failure in business. Unexpected turns of events that you could not foresee frustrate and unnerve you, knock you out of balance. You find it difficult to spend much time waiting for the outcome of any undertaking, especially if there's little confidence in its success. 
</p><p>You are recommended to frequently review your views on various aspects of life, and to put aside any outdated and unworkable traditions and habits. Dry logic of facts should not suppress in you the appreciation of all that is new and unusual. Moderate your conservatism and stubbornness. More often compare yourself to others, cultivate flexibility in your ways of competing.
</p><p>You tend to rely on your intuition in your assessments of people, not suspecting that you greatly overestimate this ability in yourself and that you are not immune from arriving at erroneous conclusions and prognoses. The consequence of this may be inappropriate or mis-attributed suspicions, and undue harshness in dealing with others, which can put you in an awkward ethical position. Try to have more restraint and tact in such questions.
</p><p>Another one of your problems is your inability to control your emotions in relation to people who are close to you, who don't obey your instructions and guidance, if their actions contradict your logic and common sense. This is all the more upsetting to your close ones, that at the same time you behave with restraint, emphasized politeness and good manners towards strangers and unfamiliar people. Your family members and close ones may feel upset and disappointed with you due to such contrasts in your behavior.
</p><p>With you lack of restraint you can alienate your loved ones. Try to be more patient, don't rush to tell the truth to a person's face. Being excessively direct usually does not work in your favor. Cool down first, then think about what is better to say, to whom, and in which manner.
</p><p>Learn to relax, to switch you focus from work to pleasant ways to take a break. Try to look at conflicts from the side of humor. You are usually endowed with a good sense of humor - it can calm you and let you vent your emotions in an acceptable form. 
</p><p>Read fiction more often. Go to the theater - such leisure activities will soften your harsh character and help you to nurture and cultivate refinement and nobility of your sentiments and feelings.
