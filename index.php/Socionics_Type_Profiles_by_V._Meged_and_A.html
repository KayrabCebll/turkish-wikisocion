<h2><span id="ILE_.28Don_Quixote.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="ILE_(Don_Quixote)">ILE (Don Quixote)</span></h2>
<p><b>ILE, ENTp (Intuitive-Logical Extrovert): INNOVATOR</b>
</p><p><b>Appearance</b>: The ILE has a somewhat scattered, thoughtful, roaming gaze. At times his looks becomes attentive, openly studying the people before him, the details of their appearance, the surrounding objects, the interior of the room, etc. Occasionally, the ILE assumes an air of importance and seriousness, or looks directly at his conversation partner, while thinking about something of his own. The mimicry of his face changes very little during conversation; at times there are glimpses of shyness and social awkwardness. The ILE often smiles trying to positively predispose his conversation partner. This smile seems cordial, although not very natural and at times seemingly inadequate to the situation. His manners and behavior are unconstrained, democratic, sometimes overly free and libertine. He tries to appear easy-going and natural, when sitting can spread out and lounge. His movements often seem uncoordinated and irresolute. It seems that he doesn't know what to do with his hands, he may lean on something even when there is no need for it. His back and posture may be a little stooped. He may walk with slightly bent knees, superfluously swinging around his hands.
</p><p><b>Character</b>: Well sees prospects of affairs in the future, he often comes to mind with new ideas and ambitious projects. He prefers to do what is interesting rather than what is beneficial. Curious, read a lot, often he changes his hobbies. Interested in unusual phenomena, when the case may be surprised with something new or sensational. He dislikes strict mode. Making up for lost time to time to arrange a rush jobs. In need of emotional stimuli, even shakes, as in the routine of his mood drops. Sometimes scattered, especially passionate about their thoughts. Compliant in matters of everyday life, but is able to impose their beliefs on others. Put pressure on him not - can not adequately respond. Responsive to the care and affection. Get out of a difficult situation himself, but willingly helps others tips. Resourceful and resolute in extreme situations. He tries to be useful and interesting to others, it supports all equal, friendly relations. In democratic dialogue. Tolerant of human weakness, but uncompromising in defending their beliefs. Poorly versed in the relationship, thus he's cautious in expressing his feelings. If confident in his chances, he may be bold and assertive. Sometimes he changes the tact, but no one for a long time it is not angry.

<h2><span id="SEI_.28Dumas.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="SEI_(Dumas)">SEI (Dumas)</span></h2>
<p><b>SEI, ISFp (Sensory-Ethical Introvert): MEDIATOR</b>
</p><p><b>Appearance</b>: The SEI typically has a soft, kind, receptive gaze that is quite expressive. Sometimes his gaze quickly moves around, carefully taking note of everything; sometimes it is attentive, staring at someone without blinking; and other times it is playful and sly. SEI's look does not seem to penetrate deeply, but reflects well the emotional state of a person. The mimicry of SEI's face is moderately lively. His smile is cordial, it seems natural, and corresponds well to the present situation and mood; at times it is somewhat coquettish. Frequently SEI's face is roundish in form. His eyes and mouth during conversation can resemble the letter "o". If his face has any large features, they become subdued by expressions of softness and kindness.

Sometimes it seems a little detached and scattered, other times studying the person before him, shy and embarrassed. Now and then EII's gaze expresses a silent reproach as a consequence of his concealed and unexpressed thoughts or impressions. His eyes are very expressive and easily convey feelings of sympathy or offense; then they convey hidden pain and melancholy, much more rarely happiness. The mimicry of his face, conversely, is very limited. Most often EII's face seems inspirited, calm and impassive, and a little tense. He smiles rarely; his smile seems shy and discreet. EII's poses and gestures are undemonstrative. He is usually a little bit restrained in conversation. The tone of his voice is muted, even his exclamations don't seem loud. He's rarely verbose and grandiloquent, but only in cases when he has to defend his opinions and principles. EII doesn't always enter an argument, nevertheless, he is very stubborn and set in his convictions.
</p><p><b>Character</b>: EII's main characteristics are attentiveness to people and a dose of humanism. He is diligent and punctual, thorough and detailed in any undertaking or assignment. Dislikes the rush, thus prepares in advance. Knows how to allocate tasks and events in time, and complete them by the deadline. Shows empathy and active kindness towards people who are close to him. Though his dedication often gets taken advantage of, as it is difficult for him to turn a person down. A little unsure of himself, not showy. Has a negative attitude towards violence and authoritarianism, opposing them with quiet stubbornness and endurance. Avoiding disputes can give way, but does not change their beliefs. Do not forgive injustice and betrayal, uncompromising in matters of morality and ethics. In other matters compliant and tolerant. He prefers to hide his emotions, even-tempered and restrained in a relationship. Revelation only with loved ones. Impressionable and vulnerable, hard to tolerate argument, she tries to reconcile the warring parties, but to be objective. Poor suffers alone, but their society does not impose.
