<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_V._Meged_and_A._Ovcharov">Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov</span></h3>
<p><b>Appearance</b>
</p><p>The sensory subtype is composed and cordial, not demonstrative, obstinate and uncompromising in defending his views and interests. Supports his positions rationally by logic and facts, and not by thought-up or assumed accounts. Diligent, laborious, patient, persistent in his work and studies. If some project captures his interest, he will tirelessly try to improve his results, both intellectual and material. At times he needs a change of occupation, but will attempt to bring previous work to completion. From time to time he becomes contemplative, withdraws into himself, distances from his social circle, submerges into his own problems. Somewhat restricted in dialogue, may be brief and to the point, but tries to be cordial and good-natured if he feels tensions come up conversation. Prefers items that are original and of good quality, yet simple and unpretentious, enjoys handmade things. Aesthete, pays attention to his health, appearance, and figure, tries to dress tastefully. Has graciously lazy gestures, at the same time confident and precise movements. Gait is a little relaxed and springy. Doesn't like to hurry, but neither is he slow. Seems somewhat proud and haughty.
</p><p><b>Character</b> 
</p><p>Original person with strongly expressed individuality, but due to indecisiveness and modesty may prefer to be in the background. Combines sober realism and practicality with a drive for self-development. If he finds his calling, can pursue it for a long time, eventually achieving high skill and professionalism. He is never fully satisfied with what has been achieved and constantly develops it further, providing the best form for the content. Curious, tangentially interested in other ways for expressing and apply his talents and abilities, trying himself in various directions. However, he poorly sees future prospects of projects and work, and due to this may miss out on important opportunities. Frequently feels disappointed regarding lost opportunities.
</p><p>Aesthete who loves convenience, nature, travel. Willingly shares his impressions and stories of the world around him with those he's sympathetic towards. Possesses a sense of humor with a touch of irony. Notices many details. Very impressionable. Intolerant of boorishness, poor tastes, callousness and crassness. Dislikes pathos, demonstrative appeals and calls, as well as prideful attitudes, conceit. He's impressed by bold, sincere, friendly, and open people, who encourage him, instill belief in success and lift his spirits. An unpredictable and independent by nature partner sparks in him a sense of curiosity and a desire to keep such a person. 
</p><p>Uncompromising in matters of principle. Does not like to concede once conquered positions, although also knows how to take into account the rules and regulations of his milieu. Quite mobile, cherishes inner personal peace and freedom of action. Sometimes finds it interesting to test himself in complex situations, to overcome difficulties, which adds to his self-affirmation, however, dislikes taking excessive risks and recklessness. Suffers from changeable moods that affect his performance. Does not like forcing himself to do something. If others violate his inner balance, he can get hot-tempered, flare up, of which later he may regret. In most situations tries to be composed and loyal.
</p><p>Poorly tolerates routine, monotony, and boredom. Falls into apathy and depression if he needs to have the same engagement for a long time. Cannot engage in lengthy paper-pushing or purely intellectual work. Dislikes abstract conversations, prefers deeds instead. Needs specific, practical activities, outdoor engagements, and frequent change of impressions for vitality. Dislikes obeying someone else's will and schedule. Won't take up useless work, but if he is passionate about something, develops high work capacity. Prepares for tasks and assignments in advance, thinking through the details of work he needs to do, to later work smoothly, accurately, and quickly. Is thorough and conscientious in his work and studies. Does everything qualitatively. Knows his own worth and feels proud of the results of his work. 
</p><p>Somewhat restrained in communication and emotional expression. With skepticism refers to active emotional displays, but is very sensitive towards compliments. Sometimes he seems unapproachable and official, though he tries to create an atmosphere of simplicity and ease. Internally emotional and vulnerable, but manages to avoid conflict by showing good judgment and diplomacy.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_V._Meged_and_A._Ovcharov_2">Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov</span></h3>
<p><b>Appearance</b>
</p><p>The logical subtype is impatient and active, loves frequent changes and new impressions. Industrious, hardworking, and very caring. His behavior is unpredictable and characterized by unexpected transitions from aloof contemplation to expedient activity. Keeps certain reserve and distance from other people, and at times can be overly direct, harsh, and inconsiderate in conversation. Very independent and proud, does as he wishes. In conversation he is prickly and ironic, but becomes friendly and shows consideration if he has sympathy and respect for his conversation partner. Noticing that he has offended someone, regrets it and softens his communication, tries to turn everything into a joke, or may even apologize and try to calm the person down. Behind his external seeming inaccessibility he is quite impressionable and vulnerable.

Likes to work as hard as he can, quickly and efficiently, with high productivity. Appreciates convenience and good working conditions.
</p><p>This is an individualist, on whom it's difficult to impose anything. Prefers to solve his problems on his own, by the means he has at his disposal. Does not like asking for help or loaning anything. Prefers to have all he needs at his disposal, to not depend on anyone else. Everything that is needed for work, project, or business he acquires in advance. Tries to have the entire inventory of "tools" needed for rational labor and active leisure time.
</p><p>All of the adaptations, equipment, and tools needed for his work he keeps in perfect order, which allows to save time in work when they become needed. Becomes very upset if he forgets to put something in its place and then has to search for it for a long time. Dislikes paperwork drudgery and finds opportunities to reduce it to a minimum. All the needed documentation he keeps in order to avoid further wasting of time.
</p><p>Usually reaches a high level of professionalism and excellence in his occupation, but is somewhat unsure in himself and diffident, prone to having doubts and fluctuations. In need of moral and material incentives. Undemonstrative, but is very sensitive to the assessment of his abilities and becomes offended if his work is not noticed and not praised. At the same time, dislikes undeserved compliments. Respects capable and talented people; tries to create all the possible conditions for the development of their abilities.
</p><p>Contrasting in his behavior: relaxed and quietly contemplative, then suddenly active and mobile. Cannot be in the same place or engage in the same task for a long time. Impatient, does not like it when the same subject is discussed at length. Himself is usually not very wordy and may be quiet. Good at distributing his own activities and assignments: if there is time he does not rush things, but once he feels that there is time to act, he becomes very mobile, hurrying himself and others. Usually does everything by the deadlines, despite the fact that he often gets distracted by other activities. Very efficient, proactive, and clever when it comes to taking care of household and economic problems. Willingly engages in physical labor, repairs things, facilities and equipment. Can do much with his own hands.
</p><p>Strives to be knowledgeable over various topics. Very curious and may read a lot. Has many diverse interests, easily learns something new. A good lecturer or teacher, as he can explain complex things simply and effectively. Does not tolerate criticism and suggestions on topic on which he views himself competent. In conversation, tries to persuade others using logic and facts. It is hard to convince him in a dispute. In what he considers to be true, he is persistent up to being obstinate: does not go for a compromise even in the most critical situations. Proving his own correctness he becomes hot-tempered, impulsive and unhinged.
</p><p>Secretive and suspicious. Dislikes being the center of attention. Finds it difficult to fit into a society he is unfamiliar and unaccustomed with. Reluctantly makes contact with unfamiliars and strangers, prefers to communicate with like-minded people. Not accepting of familiarity, can with a look or gesture to put a person in his or her place.

He can always be relied upon: reliable in friendship, love and business. Readily comes to aid of the first request, sympathizes with another's misfortune or grief. However, he can always turn away from a person who has lost his trust and respect.
</p><p>Grows tired of monotony and routine. Willingly travels. Interactions with nature calm him down. New occupations, interests, and hobbies raise his vitality and help him to overcome apathy. Often he enjoys sports, the excitement in the competition. Not averse to experiencing thrilling and risky sensations, but without the risk of injury. Careful towards all living things: people, nature, animals, and even insects. Does not "play" with his own or another's life. Does not tolerate coercion, and himself does not know how to pressure others. Find it difficult to hit anyone, but, at the same time, he is very independent and not always considerate of the interests of others when they do not coincide with his own. When someone tries to limit his freedoms, he may break up the relations.
</p><p>Has a hard time enduring through physical and mental discomfort, and tries to do everything possible to remove it. For the same reason, avoids bad habits. Closely monitors his health and physical form. Appreciates beauty and harmony in everything, although finds it difficult to reach an internal balance. Very impressionable, inclined to fall into depression even over minor reasons. A fatalist at heart, believer in the inevitability, and does not try to forcibly change the course of events. Often lacks in resoluteness.
</p><p>Suspicious and proud. Afraid to show awkward emotions or to seem intrusive, thus hides his problems from the outsiders, preferring to suffer them alone. Finds it difficult to express his feelings in words. Does not like to demonstrate how he feels in front of strangers. Tries to talk of love in a joking humorous manner, risking being misunderstood. Not sentimental, manifestation of tenderness come to him with much difficulty. Proves his love by actions and deeds and not by words. Very attentive, caring, and dedicated. If misunderstandings happen, he usually does not attempt to justify himself or make excuses. Internally he feels himself lonely, if there is no sensitive tactful person by his side, capable of understanding everything without extraneous words, and of encouraging him in times of pessimism and melancholy.
</p><p>This logical subtype of SLI is not very common, and, as we have noticed, for this reason gives the greatest number of errors in typing not only by ours, but also by foreign experts. Most often, this type is confused for type SLE (due to secrecy and distrust of the latter, which get falsely interpreted as introversion) and ILI, who often overestimates his practicality and considers himself a realist due to analytical mind and a well-developed logic of actions, as well as other types.
</p><p>Developed by us theory of i.e. accentuations, which provides both visual clues and characteristic manifestations, related to the heightened expressions of the 12 information elements of TIMs, - or rather, the subtypes - will help avoid many errors in typing and testing.
