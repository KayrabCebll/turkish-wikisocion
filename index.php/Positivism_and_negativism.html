<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Positivists_2">Positivists</span></h4>
<ul><li>Positivists initially pay attention to what is present in a situation (what exists, what is there) what can realistically occur, what can be interpreted as an affirmative manifestation of surrounding world, situations, possibilities, prospects.</li>
<li>Positivists are oriented at what any situation or contact with people can potentially bring to them rather than what they could potentially lose (for example, moving is viewed as an opportunity to gain new acquaintances, friends, rather than primarily from point of view of losing existing friends). For them an orientation to success is more characteristic rather than avoidance of failure.</li>
<li>Positivists are better at assimilating affirmative experiences. They are inclined to "convert" negative experiences into positive ones (they try to find the "silver lining").</li>
<li>They speak more of the positive and try to present negative moments on a positive background ("Yes, this is a problem, but..."—then continue to paint a positive picture). Conversations about the negative (when the other person accentuates deficiencies, absence, impossibility) may be irritating to Positivists.</li>
<li>In speech of Positivists, one can detect mostly affirmative constructions and intonations. If they are giving instructions to someone else, they present them in positive manner: they talk about what can be done or what should be done in different situations (for example, "You can call him only at this-and-this time") rather than what cannot or should not be done.</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Negativists_2">Negativists</span></h4>
<ul><li>Negativists pay attention to aspects of the situation that are insufficient or lacking, which can be interpreted as seeing the negative prospects of various situations and events.</li>
<li>Negativists orient at what they could potentially lose as a result of a certain situation or contact with other people, rather than what this situation or contact can bring to them (for example, moving for negativists primarily means losing friends). Negativists focus on avoiding failures (the "positive" development of a situation is the fact that nothing negative has happened so far).</li>
<li>Negativists are better at assimilating negating, negative experiences. They are inclined to outline negative sides of affairs.</li>
<li>Negativists are more inclined to speak about negative moments. Positive aspects are presented on a negative background ("Well, this is good, but..."—then mentions what is lacking, what is not right). Negativists are irritated by "excessively positive" attitudes (when another person "forgets" to bring up or haven't even considered the negative aspects of something).</li>
<li>In speech of negativists there is frequent use of negating expressions (negative pronouns, adverbs, "not" "cannot" "nobody" "never"). For example: "Negative experiences are not always necessary, I don't need them" "There won't be an occasion to do anything" "I cannot say that this is not true" etc. If giving instructions they first of all talk about the things to avoid, what should not be done (For example "If you call them at such a time it will be pointless").</li></ul>
<p><b>Notes</b>
</p><p>Previous research on this dichotomy was reduced to measuring positive/negative in the "everyday" sense of the word. In our opinion, these attitudes are a consequence of a deeper mechanism: one group perceives and describes something by denoting associated properties (Positivists) while the other group denotes properties that are not associated with it. Positivists describe a subject, individual, phenomenon, attempting to describe it through characteristics inherent in the object, while Negativists focus on properties that do not pertain to the object. The cursory impression of optimism/pessimism being the distinguishing feature of this dichotomy occurs because of this. In reality, both Positivists and Negativists possess these two attitudes and talk equally of "good" and "bad" things. The difference is in the form of presentation—for example, on the same topic of shortcomings: "I cannot say that you have no shortcomings" (negativism) and "You have several shortcomings" (positivism).
</p><p><b>Hypotheses</b>
</p><p>The difference in assimilating experiences between Positivists and Negativists arises because Positivists better remember events when they did transpire, rather than events that did not occur, while Negativists are better at remembering events that did not occur, that were absent or lacking (for the Negativist, this absence constitutes an event in itself, they remember this better and draw conclusions).
</p><p><b>Examples</b>
</p><p><i>Positivists:</i> "At first I trust people, distrust needs to be substantiated" "I always believe in a positive outcome. I will most likely talk about positives. I don't issue warnings of possible failures—why bring people down, may be everything will be ok" "It irritates me when people talk only of character flaws and inadequacies in others" "I try not to give instructions on avoidance or failure" "When giving instructions I avoid giving orders like "Don't do it! Don't go!" "Even negative experience can be positive" "I start off by trusting people and then work from there."
</p><p><i>Negativists:</i> "My first reaction to everything is "no!" whatever it might be" "I don't speak of the positives" "One must take into account all the negative aspects. It goes without saying that people are capable of anything" "If the mood is too good - something is not right" "In my instructions I always give people "negative" orientation points. I foresee all the negative moments and try to make provisions for them" "People in general are good, but it's better to keep your distance from them" "When I was authoring a textbook, I constructed my proofs "by method of contradiction"" "Most often I bring bad news" "When asked "How's it going?" I answer "Not well." "How am I going to entertain myself? Certainly I wouldn't go to a restaurant, neither a casino ... but somewhere out to nature..." "There will be a building there, but that's not what you're looking for. After that you will see a street, but don't take it, continue on your path. Go around the building and don't use the first two entrances."

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Description_from_Forms_of_Cognition_by_V._Gulenko">Description from <a href="Gulenko_Cognitive_Styles.html" title="Gulenko Cognitive Styles"> Forms of Cognition</a> by V. Gulenko</span></h3>
<p>Positivism I understand as the tendency to maximize the positive, Negativism as the tendency to minimize the negative. Positivists primarily perceive the positive side of any phenomenon, and often turn a blind eye to the negative. Negativists won't overlook problems, and simultaneously mitigate any positive aspects to their situation of interest.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Intellectual_Level">Intellectual Level</span></h4>
<p>At this level, the Positivism–Negativism dichotomy manifests as identification of similarities or differences in object comparison. In Negativists thought processes prevails contrast, in Positivists leads comparison. Meaning that Positivists more easily hold overall views of an object, without considering its internal divisions. Conversely, Negativists more easily distinguish its extreme points of separation and opposing contrasts.
</p><p>Directly relevant to this is a dichotomy known in cognitive psychology as convergent/divergent thinking [5], discovered by J. P. Guilford. In his opinion, divergent thinking, from simple initial data, yields several different solutions to the same problem; a trait characteristic to the alternative-thinking of Negativists.
</p><p>Opposite this, convergent thinking searches for a single valid encompassing solution; a trait more characteristic to Positivist thinking. For them, a problem is unsolved until the validity of one solution is proven against other alternatives.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Level">Social Level</span></h4>
<p>Positivism–Negativism affects the degree of internal group coherence and regulates attraction/repulsion between its members.
</p><p>An individual's ability to assimilate into a group is typologically predictable. Negativists are remote types. They need constant assurance, even in a group they consider their own. Therefore it is more difficult to fully integrate Negativists into a group. Positivists on the other hand, are inclined to close range communication. They do not polarize contrasts, but smooth them over in one way or another. Thus Positivists facilitate monocentric group structure and unity of purpose. Whereas Negativists amplify polarizing forces conducive to polycentric group structure.
</p><p>Consider the example of <i>SEI</i>, a fairly good-natured type, although Negativist. Is there a behavioral tendency towards remoteness? Yes, it contrasts its subgroup with other subgroups. Thereby disrupting, unintentionally or not, unity of purpose in the whole group overall.
</p><p>What process balances internal group cohesion? It is observed that Positivists are drawn towards their opposite, which contributes to overall group solidarity, particularly through the ease of intragroup role distribution. Negativists on the other hand, have an inherent paradoxical attraction to those similar to themselves. The nearer such parallel charged elements converge, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to implement mutual action. Repulsive forces rapidly emerge and fracture group integration.
</p><p>The overall incidence of monolithic or polarized group behavior is a reliable index for gauging Positivist–Negativist tendencies. Negativism generates tension in intragroup relations, leading on one hand to an increase in psychological distance between members, but on the other hand activating its internal momentum to say "Move!". Positivism by contrast contracts psychological distance and encourages internal group cohesion, but can also bring complacency, carelessness, and 'vapidity' of existence.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychological_Level">Psychological Level</span></h4>
<p>In a psychological sense, this dichotomy can be approximately interpreted as trust/distrust.
</p><p>Each type of person behaves in life according to how they answer the following existential question: is human nature inherently good or evil? For Positivists, human nature is inherently good, so they are more likely to be trusting. This does not mean that they consciously consider themselves to be good, just that they conduct themselves as if others were. Negativists even under favorable conditions are inclined to expect the worst. Their degree of trust in others is therefore is much lower.
</p><p>The relation between Positivists and Negativists is illustrated well by the analogy of electric conductors. Electric-people (Negativists who have accumulated a negative psychological charge) discharge into conductor-people (Positivists), who tend to provoke them in just the right way to do so. All of which happens mostly automatically and unconsciously. The resulting emotional flash establishing temporary balance of psychological (electro-)potentials. This beneficial surge of emotional release, Aristotle in his "Poetics" called 'catharsis'—psychological purging via intense experience.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Physical_Level">Physical Level</span></h4>
<p>The spatial arrangement of conversation parties in front or near is a key factor in communication, its importance first stressed by Harry S. Sullivan. Negativists gain leverage in communication from positions opposite the partner, Positivists from positions alongside or at an angle deflecting a straight-on gaze.
</p><p>Automatic reductions in confrontation due to being seated side by side, are a common method used by marital psychologists working with couples. Sitting side by side and addressing an imaginary third party, enables couples to gradually decrease the severity of sore conflict.
</p><p>Clinical psychologists studying nonverbal cues classify gestures indicative of critical attitudes. Such gestures are typically 'closed'—for instance, a hand at the mouth. From a Socionics standpoint then, closed demeanor is better explained by Negativism, not Introversion.
</p><p>Negativism induces tangible bodily tension. Negativists are inclined to accumulate 'charge', making highly-charged Negativists easily overexcitable (especially if also Dynamic). In order to compensate against this, Negativists are recommended to engage in physical exercise that relaxes and smooths internal tension. While Positivists are recommended to perform physical exercise that excites and intensifies their physiological processes.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Additional_Commentary_and_Notes">Additional Commentary and Notes</span></h2>
<p>Positivism-Negativism is often mistaken for optimism-pessimism, where Positivism has become synonymous with optimism, and Negativism - with pessimism. By extension, those who fall into Eneagram's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.fitzel.ca/enneagram/harmonics.html#pos">positive outlook triad</a> (these are types 2,7,9) are sometimes mistaken for Positivist types due to these triad's innate preference for dealing with problems by adopting a "positive attitude", for as much as possible, and reframing disappointments in some more uplifting way; while the often mistrustful attitude and propensity to mentally dwell on problems and threats of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/typesix.asp">enneagram type 6</a> can be mistaken for Negativism. <b>It is important to note that there is no direct relation between Positivist-Negativist Reinin dichotomy and optimism-pessimism. The name of this dichotomy should not be interpreted literally. Positivists do not have an inherently positive outlook on life, and Negativists - a negative one.</b> The Positivist-Negativist dichotomy describes certain kinds aspects of cognitive perception and mental operations rather than person's outlook, attitudes, and prevalent emotional state. Optimism-pessimism is a quality that arises from personal experiences; socionics factors do not influence and condition this phenomenon in itself.
</p><p>A distinguishing trait of Positivist and Negativist types is the preference for comparison (Positivists) or contrast (Negativists). Positivist types are more inclined to spot similarities and draw analogies ("they are so alike", "y is just like x" etc.), while Negativist are inclined to instead look at contrasts or alternatives ("they are nothing alike!"). Figuratively speaking, if Positivists are shown the front side then they will be looking at the front side, while Negativists will try to look at its inverse. If this inverse is not readily apparent, they will start searching for it. Thus Negativists do not seek to present a "negative" or "pessimistic" view of things, but simply the inverse or the alternative one. It is precisely due to such mental preference that a Negativist type such as ILI voices pessimistic predictions upon hearing optimistic forecasts. From a Negativist's point of view, he or she is not being a downer, but rather restoring the balance by pointing out the opposite. Since Negativist types are inclined to look for the inverse, if they are presented with pessimistic information they start searching for its alternatives, for what is absent and not there, such as a more optimistic interpretation. If the same ILI is told that everything is bleak, he or she will proceed to look for evidence that the situation is really not as bleak as it could have been. This distinguishes socionics trait of Negativism from manifestations of personal traits such as pessimism, depression, or  propensity to "catastrophize".  
</p>
<dl><dd>Example: LII, negativist: "This is very much how I process information. I compare of what something logically cannot be, so then I know what something can be. I always seem to look for what's not there in general in order to arrive at what's there."</dd></dl>
<p>Thus, Positivists, in contrast to Negativists that see and investigate alternatives to anything, at times make an impression of being too "one-track" minded, too oriented at "one way", "one method", "one opinion", stubbornly enforcing a singular opinion, viewpoint, or interpretation, or feeling exasperated when that single track has failed them due to weak ability to see anything alternative. This shows more strongly for C-D types than V-S types, due to V-S propensity to loop back and try to correct the initial mistake, wrong attitude, or opinion.
</p><p>Another point of confusion: Criticalness and Positivist-Negativist trait. Under this misinterpretation, Positivist types are depicted as always accepting, never critical of anything. This, of course, does not hold up to the scrutiny of the statements of Positivist types. Positivist types can and do critically treat information albeit with some delay (especially information relayed on their ego block functions), but the manner in which they voice their criticisms differs from Negativist types. Positivist types are more inclined to voice affirmative statements that use irony or aburdism to highlight the incorrectness of some argument and demonstrate their own disbelief (Example: Highlighting parts of a type's description that doesn't fit them, and then exclaiming with irony "Yes, I see how that applies to me!") <br />
Criticisms of Negativist types, in contrast, are usually directly negating, eliminating, or invalidating statements. Negativist types as if "cut off", or bar some information (or people) that they've found to be dubious. <br />
In general, Positivists are initially more open and accepting of new information (and people), but later may reject it after a more critical consideration; while Negativists have larger initial barrier to "entry" of new information (and people), but have greater difficulty getting rid of something that they have already accepted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
<p>Note that a single statement is not enough to determine where a person belongs on this dichotomy. What is important is the <i>relative proportion</i> of the two in person's lexicon - negating statements are found at higher frequency in the statements of negativist types than of positivist types. Below are a few possible examples of such statements.
</p><p>Examples of now Positivist/Negativist phrasing differs from positive/negative content:
</p>
<ul><li>Positivist: "Yes, life is crap." - affirmative phrasing, but the message is pessimistic or negative in content.</li>
<li>Negativist: "No, life isn't crap." - negating phrasing, but the message is optimistic or positive in content.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Positivist: "Yes, life is wonderful." - affirmative framing of optimistic content.</li>
<li>Negativist: "No, life isn't wonderful." - negating framing of pessimistic content.</li></ul>
<p>Negativism:
</p>
<ul><li>LII, negativist: "This is very much how I process information. I compare of what something logically cannot be, so then I know what something can be. I always seem to look for what's not there in general in order to arrive at what's there."</li>
<li>IEE negativist: "I find myself saying things like: "she isn't a mean person." instead of "she's a nice person" and "I'm not sad" instead of "I'm happy." It feels more realistic and tempered and I don't know. Negativism isn't being negative, it's stating even positive things in a way that makes them more neutral...in my mind, at least."</li>
<li>IEE, negativist Fi: "There are very few people here I don't like, and you aren't one of them. As for the question from the OP, maybe it's because I'm an Fi negativist, but I seem to only be able to think of people I don't want to get to know better. LOL. And, again, it's only a few people."</li>
<li>IEE, negativist: "You can't win at a game you aren't playing"</li>
<li>LSE, negativist: "Hey, that's not bad" (as a compliment)</li>
<li>IEE, negativist: "I do not see Barack as EII - he is not ethical enough or intuitive enough and I know my Mirrors, and I do not think Michelle is LSI - she is not intellectually pragmatic enough or Introvert enough."</li>
<li>ESI, negativist Fi: "I acutely feel poor attitudes — towards myself or between other people. I can see it right away and I am never wrong in this. But when it comes to good relations I orient rather poorly ... Two days ago my boyfriend introduced my girlfriend to his friend. I watched the couple the entire evening, but couldn't discern if his friend liked her or not. There were no signs of negative attitude, that's for sure, but I couldn't estimate the degree of good relations either." (difficulty picking up on affinities, relationship is assessed by looking for inverse of positive relations).</li></ul>
<p>Positivism:
</p>
<ul><li>SLI, positivist: "Yahoo answers are, of course, intellectual - a good place to get your information." - delivering an ironic criticism. Her intent is to indicate that Yahoo answers is a poor source of information, but as a Positivist type she makes an affirmative ironic statement to get her point across rather than a negating, disqualifying statement.</li>
<li>IEI, positivist: "Yes, Ti is autism" - making an ironic criticism. Same as SLI in the example above she condenses another poster's writing to a single affirmative ironic statement to point out the absurdity of what another person has said (involution + positivism).</li>
<li>SLI, positivist: "But it's nice to see you are searching for ways to discredit other people's socionics functions. What a noble effort and worthwhile activity" - while criticizing another poster yet framing his criticisms into affirmative statements.</li>
<li>EII, positivist: "I relate to most of what has been said. These parts of the profile apply to me [proceeds to highlight the applicable parts]" - as a positivist type she is highlighting and affirming the parts of the profile that work for her rather than discussing what the profile doesn't mention.</li>
<li>EII, positivist: "I will critically refer to anything that is being said to me and try to analyze it, this comes naturally to me. It's like I pick up something and try to examine it closely, polish it, remove the dust, and work on it until it starts making sense to me. Discussing it with others helps me to clarify anything that I'm uncertain about."</li></ul>
