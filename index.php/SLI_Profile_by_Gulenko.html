<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_description">General description</span></h2>
<p>Values convenience and quality. Gives preference to comfort in clothing rather than appearance. Sensitively reacts to touch and any extraneous odors. Enjoys quiet communion with nature. Caring in relation to family and friends.
</p><p>Prudent and economical. Inventive and resourceful at home and at work, if he happens to enjoy it. Skeptical of slogans and boisterous appeals, prefers to go by common sense. Stubborn and uncompromising in that which he considers to be correct. Though he is distrustful of new ideas, after testing them in practice is able to extract benefit from them.
</p><p>Independent. Proud, even haughty. In need of a sensitive approach, praise, and attention. Inclined towards skepticism. Poorly sees the future evolution of events. Concerned about making timely choices in life, yet feels dependent on the vicissitudes of fate.
</p><p>Impressionable, poorly controls his emotions during a dispute. Doesn't know how to express his feelings openly. Life's hardships make him resort to "black" humor. At times he is taken by pessimism and apathy; instead of encouraging a person, he becomes taken in by their negative state.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Detailed_description">Detailed description</span></h2>
<p>Learns about the world through first-hand experience and travel. Sensitive towards all that disrupts the natural harmony. Rejects any artificiality, factitious displays, unhealthy instincts. Caring in relations to close ones. If he sees that the person is not feeling well will come to his aid. If he considers someone to be his friend, doesn't leave that person in need. Perceptive of potentialities that are related to senses. In pursuit of sensory novelty often leads an active way of life (fishing, hiking, swimming, travel, etc.). Cannot tolerate monotony and descent into inertia. Internally sensitive and vulnerable, easily wounded, although does not show this outwardly. In order to survive, adapts to the prevailing mores; if necessary, follows the established norms.
</p><p>SLI is economical and prudent in dealing with material resources. He is more likely to try to mend old and worn out things than to throw them away. His mindset has a technological bent. He searches for simple but effective methods for resolving problems. Before taking on some task, SLI thinks over several options to achieve the desired result, and stops on the most economical one. Works only by methods that are most convenient to him. Notes those who shrink away from work and ponders about how to make them work or get rid of them. Himself will do only that which is necessary. Works well with any instruments, masterfully applies technical equipment. Often can work well with his hands. Constantly tries to improve his knowledge, skill, and professional level in any chosen field of activity. Hopes for guaranteed and quick results based on rational organization of his labor and studies.
</p><p>Usually doesn't run late turning in his assignments and work, but enjoys turning things in on time. Worries that he will be assigned an inconvenient for him schedule. In dealing with people demonstrates a quality of "being taken in by life". Shows his skepticism by employing specific kind of humor, ironizes. However, deep in his soul he remains an optimist and doesn't lose hope in a positive outcome. In an emergency situation, he doesn't panic but looks for ways to buy time. Follows and orients by his inner impressions to the external events. Feels dependent on the vicissitudes of fate. Takes on life's shocks, trying to protect his loved ones from them; however, it is difficult for him to bear such burden for long.
</p><p>Shows a contrast in expression of his emotions: at times he is cool and self-absorbed, like "iceberg in the ocean", at other times – excited and energetic.

Aims to bring what he has started to completion.

If you communicate with him on a friendly and personal basis, frequently compliment to his abilities, provide him with the opportunity to work following his own methods, your success in interacting with him is guaranteed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement">Recommendations for self-improvement</span></h2>
<p>Your strength is an inexhaustible curiosity of the phenomena of the surrounding world. You aspire to be knowledgeable in different fields, willingly travel, while not just being an observer to the circumstances of life, nature and architecture. You have a well-developed sense of taste and measure.
</p><p>The main value in your life is convenience, both in physical sense and in relations with other people. Crude manners, tactlessness, lack of human warmth from those around you deeply wound you. You strive for inner emotional harmony and a healthy style of life.
</p><p>Your other strong point is your logic that allows you to efficiently conduct your business. You possess a sense of what constitutes actual, concrete benefit. In your actions you adhere to what is sensible to do. You steer away from useless projects.
</p><p>If some work interests you, you can develop a great working tenacity, acting in an accurate, steady, measured manner. In such cases, you will think of all the practical details in advance, prepare all that is necessary, displaying ingenuity, industriousness and alacrity.
</p><p>Your weak trait - an inability to express your feelings to other people, due to which others may think of you as a cold and heartless person. Internal tensions that are inherent to you sometimes prompt flashes of anger and aggression, when you find it hard to contain your emotions, and later you may come to regret this.
</p><p>Since displaying emotional nuances is hard for you, you prefer to talk in a joking manner to sentimentality, due to this you can sometimes be misunderstood. Failures you prefer to endure in silence and solitude. To avoid any misunderstanding of situations, try to trust your partner and talk to him in a serious tone.
</p><p>Another significant problem is your considerable propensity towards skepticism, which contributes to your pessimistic attitude toward the future. At times you indulge in melancholy and gloom, lose your motivation and give up. Your apathy in many cases narrows your scope and prevents you from achieving more in life, which you can see from your personal experience.
</p><p>You may be recommended to travel more often, seek changes even in details of habitual way of life. New experiences may lead to an interest in history.
</p><p>Try to find a job to your liking, which will fill your life with meaning, and will orient you towards the future. Enthusiasm for your work is a good cure for skepticism and apathy.
</p><p>Don't let the melancholy take over you. At such times, go visit friends, or for a walk, to the movies, the park. Spend more time around cheerful, enthusiastic people, that will charge you up with positive emotions and new impressions.
