<dl><dd>I am not like the others.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Once upon a time, long long ago - as if it was yesterday - at dawn, from the gates of his house, rode out a rider on an old nag and a cardboard helmet on his head high. And stopped.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The sun rose over the chain of distant mountains. The new day, like all the previous ones, was promising to be hot.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The silence was so sleepy that it seemed that life itself has fallen asleep.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The whole world was in full view. All roads were waiting for him ...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>... Flick of reins ... first kick of a hoof spurred a cloud of golden dust ... BA-BOOM! - And the silence was broken with a roar, like crystal, and the world began to move again, again spun galaxies, the South Atlantic Gulf Stream was once again gleaming with multi-colored jets of water, while sleepy people began to rub their surprised from long hibernation eyes.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Later, for a long time they will swear at this idiot who woke them up, and won't be able to get back to sleep. A new day has started, a new life.</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="And_then_he_came_up_with_such_a_strange_idea.2C_which_has_never_occurred_in_none_madman_in_the_world"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="And_then_he_came_up_with_such_a_strange_idea,_which_has_never_occurred_in_none_madman_in_the_world">And then he came up with such a strange idea, which has never occurred in none madman in the world</span></h2>
<p>If we try to trace the development of any phenomenon or objects created by man, then at the very beginning, at the source, will always find an idea, "a strange idea." And make no mistake - this idea first occurred to ILE.
</p><p>"Think" and "invent" for it is almost the same. In his fantasies, he lived a thousand different lives, imagining themselves in different situations.
</p><p>Is naturally can imagine yourself to be liked kinogeroya, reading a book, at some point, will stand on line and in your mind will continue the story in their own way. In those few seconds of complete detachment from reality, he can live a decent life segment invented and when wakes up, puzzled for a moment - in what is the reality of it now?
</p><p>By and large, in order to fly away into the fantasy, he had the insignificance trifle - casually abandoned companion word, drawing on asphalt, forms clouds. And - now just seems that ILE is still around. In fact, he may already be on a pirate sailing ship or on another planet.
</p><p>But instead of thinking about work, I began to think about the reason the seas and oceans: what are found in the seas, whales and sharks, why whales are so big, and that it would, if the whales were carried out on the ground and walked on streets, and where we would live if some whale destroyed our home.
</p><p>No wonder that at that moment he ignored the question addressed to him or examiner will travel a few extra stops on the tram. You see, this "around here and seychasnaya" routine for him - as a five-meter pool for dolphins can live, but what a life!
</p><p>However the result of this fantasy is not the only one absent-mindedness. This is - a way of understanding the world, especially its new features. Combined in his irrepressible imagination already known elements of reality, ILE creates a new reality, which opens exciting new prospects.
</p>
<h2><span id="Where_are_these_giants.3F_-_Yes.2C_here_they_are_in_front_of_you.21"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_are_these_giants?_-_Yes,_here_they_are_in_front_of_you!">Where are these giants? - Yes, here they are in front of you!</span></h2>
<p>Of a million crazy ideas that ILE can "give to the surface" of his life, at least one, but is sure to be a genius. But the point is that he does not judge which one. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the people around him, too, can not do it right away, but they can (under favorable conditions) did not give it to sink into oblivion. ILE itself is unlikely to translate their ideas into reality: it only says it is possible, it is useful, it is very necessary - and throws them somewhere, to someone. Let him personally they do not bring any money, but it is much more important that his ideas have not gone to market.
</p><p>My true vocation - is open and invent.
</p><p>His fantasy gives not only an understanding of the potential of all that surrounds him. It helps him in unusual cases that require a quick decision. When he is not in personal experience, comes to the rescue "experience" invented thousands of lives. ILE instantly versed in them and finds almost the best way out of a critical situation. As to why he did just that - and then be happy to explain their actions in advance and not thought out.
</p><p>However the determining factor is accumulated knowledge. If he has the baggage is not big, and the intuition of little help. Yes, ILE is capable of self-examination to find previously unknown to him any proof of the theorem, but even the greatest genius would not be able to do this without the knowledge of mathematics.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Better_to_rely_on_intuition_rather_than_on_common_sense">Better to rely on intuition rather than on common sense</span></h2>
<p>It may seem that ILE shares his real and invented lives. And sometimes it does happen, but in this case it is completely out in the fantasy world, forever leaving something nasty to him the reality. This is a case of "problem" ILE. If he is good, he takes their fancy just as different facets of real life. Yes, he loves his ideas, but also a very real respect for life in all its manifestations. He likes to watch her and make conclusions based on the facts that are found in his way, or rather, that give the people around him - he has some indirect way of looking at life. So he likes to listen to people and their judgment about everyone and everything.
</p><p>Nature often does not regret for ILE no memory, no insight. Even the most fleeting fact is not forgotten them, and at the right time often returns an ingenious idea. It can be very witty, and his word sharper swords and blasting dynamite. Able to ignite controversy literally from nothing. For some, the process of dispute ILE it more interesting result. In this case, be prepared for the fact that he will not agree to any practically your statement, and if you're lucky enough compelling reasons "priperetsya him to the wall," with confidence: "I said it!"
</p><p>In ILE highly developed logic and analytical skills. Based on the appearance of minor facts can make far-reaching conclusions. He is in a constant endeavor to establish connections between any of the phenomena of life ... and then, sometimes recklessly, share them with someone who first comes handy. Loves it when these abilities are recognized and valued by others.
</p><p>Can not spare time and energy to ensure that it is better to learn to do root cause analysis. He does not like people with "sloppy" style of thinking. According to him, everything in the world to be logical.
</p><p>Monotonous, tedious work, not paperwork for ILE, at any age, he plays in the hobby. Work will start if he could turn it into a game. He was seriously obey any discipline and can not stand when he is required unquestioning obedience instruction.
</p><p>I can not stand organically, when I try to squeeze in a vise discipline!
</p><p>In any case tends to bring something new, constantly improvising and her plans. If there is not a person who can gently and unobtrusively withhold his dashing aside and throwing from side to side - to fill up everything what only dotyanet. And right there in the ruins will build something new and interesting. His eternal creativity have time to stop ("All that is enough"), because he does not know the steps.
</p><p>ILE is engaged in that interesting, but not that profitable. Information that interested him, "seizes on the fly", but not always enough, for example, to be successful, hence the disruption to their studies. From the point of view of a child of this type of teacher employed only by constantly "chew" is that all long understood.
</p><p>Well versed in the ways of achieving any goals, but this seems to have it only in order to give good advice to others. For the very same myself usually nothing intelligent to think not. Comes a problem - and then it will be solved but somehow advance to prepare for it or try to prevent it is unlikely to be.
</p><p>Its efficiency and enterprise given to someone else's disposal, so that he will try other better than themselves. For ILE can always turn to the business problems, even just a hint, and it will not immediately write out just what or how, but he will also do everything. It will help so long until he sees that people are able to cope with everything else without interference.
</p><p>In his promises sometimes not necessary. If he says, "Okay, okay," it means (in most cases) that he can do what promised, but not the fact that he would certainly do it. Circumstances change - and change his intentions.
</p><p>Time to communicate does not regret not interrupt a friendly party because of some cases (if the matter promptly, can arrange so that it itself over to the right for a moment.)
</p><p>If I steal time, man - I steal his freedom.
</p><p>Because of the distraction and nesobrannosti might be late for the meeting. But try to find (or invent) a compelling reason to delay. He does not like to be taught to properly allocate your time or ask to be prudent.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="All_the_people_I_do_not_care_-_I_love_them_individually">All the people I do not care - I love them individually</span></h2>
<p>If you say that ILE tactless, it is nothing to say. Real dialogue, which took place the day after the news of the death of a prominent politician:
</p><p>- Oh, did you hear what happened? And what do you think? 
- (ILE, enthusiastically) It's beautiful!
</p><p>Honestly, it was not a bloodthirsty fanatic, and quite a good man, and his heart is not a stone. Just the thought of his capture possible positive change, and he did not think that the death - it is a tragedy, especially for those who loved the man.
</p><p>But from ILE difficult to demand that he acted ethically. If you are a crowd, then the situation will become even worse. The French have an expression "enfant terrible" (terrible child). Literally it means that sometimes small children can still unwise to issue IS that all present would like to bury myself.
</p><p>ILE to gray hair is a child. Young children such behavior is forgiven Well, it means that we all need to be consistent to the end.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Accept_me_for_who_I_am">Accept me for who I am</span></h2>
<p>ILE wants to be accepted for what it is, therefore, in itself nothing embellishes frankly all his qualities. Stranger with whom he might then have close contacts can tell their main shortcomings. And then ask: "And you can boast? Until we moved in together, it would be good to know about each other the worst."
</p><p>As a child, he believes that all people are good and that they love each other. This faith, if you are lucky and he will not face a betrayal, can carry through life. Very easily caught the obvious slander vulnerable to intrigue.
</p><p>I do not like being in quarrels pass on personal data, do not like it when someone is discussed in his absence, and when applied to human beings to affect social status, nationality, skin color, etc. I even sometimes beat. But it's not important, it's true is true.
</p><p>Friends did not choose - choose it. He has a wide circle of friends, but to determine who is better and who is worse, can not. He sees well the worth of people, but how they relate to it and how they will behave in certain specific cases, does not know. Because of this, he often falls into the trap.
</p><p>Sometimes, to get a little sense of this, likes to put experiments on people, if that's to do so, what will they do? Have much to say in response? Now try not to. What happens in this case?
</p><p>So he gathers the facts on the basis of which then makes its findings.
</p><p>Pretty funny and awkward when the situation requires initiatives in expression of feelings - he knew nothing about it. This is not to say that ILE is not capable of deep feelings, the great and sincere affection. In the sense it is "like a dog" (or student) - understands everything, but can not say anything. Love he shows care and protection, but not nice words. To people tied very tightly.
</p><p>ILE is prone to frequent, but short-lived quarrels with loved ones. In this case, smooth all rough edges better for them - he only knows how to create difficulties in communication and then naparyvatsya them. If he sees that the people close to sincerely try to create a warm, welcoming environment - for its part will actively assist them in this.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Simplicity_is_worse_than_theft">Simplicity is worse than theft</span></h2>
<p>He also loves to complicate their lives, and builds it into my life principle. The word "easy" for him synonymous with "boring." The thrill of it is recharged. The more emotion around and panic, he actively and confidently. You can not scare him - it has the opposite effect. If it turns out in a difficult situation, for help usually does not go - do not let pride and ambition.
</p><p>Optimist, almost always gives the impression of an energetic and cheerful person who can playfully tackle any problem. However, it does happen sometimes attacks the spleen, when he did not want to do it with no one willing to talk (and not because that someone was offended.) Can spend days lying on the couch, his nose buried in the wall ...
</p><p>... Or play for hours on the computer stupid games.
</p><p>Way out of this funk is trying to find itself, for example the work boot. But the emotional support of others will not be superfluous here. Instant way out of depression provided if to tell him that an idea he once gave, was classy and cool all helped.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Then_we_began_to_look_for_a_hammer_and_finally_found_it_in_my_hands">Then we began to look for a hammer and finally found it in my hands</span></h2>
<p>All trying to meet his needs he does not like to be dependent, but subconsciously he wants someone to take care of his daily life, comfort and convenience. He lives in a world of ideas, and the things he does not particularly care about them as if he does not see. Long cold look in your bag and pockets his notebook, which is nearby, on the same (pustom!) table.
</p><p>And if that someone does not care, he can go hungry, dirty and disheveled. In his things can be a real chaos that appealed to him. Sometimes a really scary to go to visit a lonely ILE: it seems there seventy years are preserved intact in the museum exposition devastation of the Civil War.
</p><p>To the needs of the body can also do not pay much attention. Simply forget to eat or come to visit, having made twenty miles in the heat cycling, only half an hour to remember that the "dying of thirst."
</p><p>If he is sick, can hardly tell that it hurts: the doctor knows best. No matter how ill, if he will make a verdict of "healthy", ILE will run as usual until not fall.
</p><p>Or the saga of how the ILE buying shoes. Put on one leg turned back and forth. So nothing decided, raised his head, looked at his friend: "Well, I'm not pressing?"
</p><p>Well here you say?
</p><p>I once tried to describe himself - made a list of two dozen definitions, some of which contradict each other.
</p><p>In conclusion, we give the words of one ILE, and, honestly, the best ending you can imagine:
</p><p>But it's not all that has the audacity to call me.
