<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_description">General description</span></h2>
<p>The LIE (ENTj) is an enterprising person who can literally "light up" with what he's doing. He is given to innovation - takes notice of new ideas and theories and aims to find them a practical application. Active and restless, often interested in travel and active types of sport: hiking, climbing, running. Loves nature, endows it with a special meaning. Always know what his is aiming for and explains this goal to those around him.
</p><p>He boldly experiments, disproving ordinary notions. Not afraid to take risks, relying on his intuitive foresight to orient in various situations. Often he is endowed with a rich imagination and is able to come up with the most unusual ideas. Distinguished by having intellectual interests in various fields. A good inventor, experimenter, and technician. Seeks to act in advance, because he knows that tomorrow will be too late. 
</p><p>Optimistic, possesses a good sense of humor. His jokes, however, are not always appropriate. Experiences problems with reliability of human relations. Because of his lack of discernment in making contacts, he can be pulled into questionable ventures. Restless, talks a lot without paying attention to lack of time.
</p><p>Does not assign much importance to order and comfort around him. Nature usually endows him with health and stamina, which he is committed to support by various methods. He does not tolerate idle pastime, due to which he cannot relax even during vacations. He is not very much worried about the outer appearance, if only his plans and goals do not suffer.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Detailed_description">Detailed description</span></h2>
<p>LIE is very perceptive of positive possibilities of new projects and undertakings. He knows how to turn things around so that they bring him tangible benefits. Criticizes those who, from his point of view, are engaged in useless theories. Adventurous, easily takes off at any moment. Often takes up dynamic types of sports - running, hiking, climbing, etc. Not afraid to travel and to change his place of residence. Bravely forwards objective proposals and presses for their implementation. If the possibilities of the project have been exhausted, quickly changes direction and switches to something new. Takes care of his finances and if he has a sum of money tries to keep it turning over, playing on the price differences. Tries to concentrate the levers of material interest in his hands.
</p><p>LIE intuitively captures the main trends that develop over time. He is not afraid to take risks, relying on his intuition. He is proactive and tries to act in advance, because he knows that tomorrow it will be too late. LIE is usually one of the first people to take advantage of new technologies and methods of organization. In his thoughts, he is constantly referencing the past, analyzing past events and drawing lessons from them for the future. LIE is attempting to find the basic laws of life and fate by analyzing that has occurred over time. He is interested in all the unusual and mysterious phenomena. He tries to test them, to find their rational basis.
</p><p>An optimist - does not get discouraged under any circumstances. Life upheavals and stressful events only toughen him and make more confident. He likes to laugh and entertain people. Enters contact with someone by involving him with a humorous remark. His humor is often sly and contain hints and double meanings. Easily enters into arguments and bets, especially if he is challenged. When arguing his points is often ironic, ridicules the views of his opponent. His irritability and hot temper may be unpleasant to others. However, he himself is not perceptive of this and believes that he is simply exchanging opinions.
</p><p>Can live and work in conditions of discomfort and lack of amenities. Nature usually endows him with stamina and good health. Not picky about food and design of the his living space. Little worried about his appearance. Has a tendency to wear the same clothing once he has gotten used to it.
